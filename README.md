# Blood-Donation-System-using-c++

This project is a simple C++ program that simulates a basic blood donation system. The system allows users to:

Add Donor Information: Donors can easily register by providing their name, gender, date of birth, blood group, and the number of blood packets they are donating.
Add Patient Information: Patients can request blood by specifying their name and the desired blood group. The system will display available compatible blood groups and issue one blood packet per request.
View Blood Inventory: Admins can view the current inventory of available blood units for each blood group(A+, O+, B+, AB+, A-, O-, B-, AB-).

Key Features:

Object-Oriented Programming: The system utilizes C++ classes (blood_bank, admin, donor, patient) for better code organization and maintainability.
Basic User Interface: Provides a simple and understandable menu for user interaction.
Blood Group Compatibility: Implements basic blood group compatibility checks.
Data Handling: Manages blood inventory within the program's memory (no external file storage).
